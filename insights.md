**Insight 1: Does Market Sentiment Affect Trader Profitability?**
The scatter plot shows that trader profitability (Closed PnL) does not have a strong linear correlation with market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index), but extreme sentiment levels—both fear and greed—often coincide with higher volatility and larger profit or loss outcomes. This suggests that while sentiment alone may not predict profit, emotional market extremes present both risk and opportunity for traders.
