****KEY INSIGHTS****

**Insight 1: Does Market Sentiment Affect Trader Profitability?**

*The scatter plot shows that trader profitability (Closed PnL) does not have a strong linear correlation with market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index), but extreme sentiment levels—both fear and greed—often coincide with higher volatility and larger profit or loss outcomes. This suggests that while sentiment alone may not predict profit, emotional market extremes present both risk and opportunity for traders.*

**Insight 2: Are Trading Volumes Higher During Fear or Greed?**

*The box plot shows that trading volume tends to be highest during 'Fear' conditions, with more extreme outliers and wider volume distribution compared to other sentiment categories. This suggests that market participants may become more active during moderate fear, potentially due to uncertainty or perceived buying opportunities.*

**Insight 3: How Does Sentiment Affect Number of Traders?**

*The bar plot reveals that the average number of active traders is highest during "Extreme Fear" and steadily decreases as market sentiment shifts toward "Greed" and "Extreme Greed". This indicates that traders are more likely to participate during uncertain or fear-driven conditions, possibly due to panic or perceived opportunities.*

**Insight 4: Do Trading Profits/Loss Fluctuate on Different Days of the Week?**

*The bar chart reveals that trader profitability varies by day, with Saturdays yielding the highest average profits and Wednesdays being the least profitable. This pattern suggests that weekend trading may offer unique opportunities, while mid-week may present challenges that impact performance.*
